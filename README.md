# pyfriends
Python implementation of the paper "PyFriends: The First Fully Generalized Friends-of-Friends Extragalactic Galaxy Group Finder", using a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm for galaxy group detection, augmented by graph theory approaches. 

In this repository we do the graph theoretic things, such that the galactic friendships can be made to be done. 

A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in the paper above linked on ArXiv.org.

## Installation

Download the repository through Git (For Windows, you can download Git Bash For Windows here).
